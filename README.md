Literate Drag and Drop Using the Racket GUI
===========================================

[This example was created for the [2023 Racket Summer Event](https://racket.discourse.group/t/the-2023-racket-summer-event).]

The [Racket Programming Language](https://www.racket-lang.org/) has an excellent cross-platform [GUI](https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/index.html) that doesn't 
get as much attention as it deserves. In this example, I describe one way to implement a drag-and-drop protocol using the Racket GUI. Although not 
required, it will be helpful to have basic familiarity with the Racket GUI and its classes.
